<h1 style="color: #a35edb;">Student Improvement Model Overview</h1>
<p>The student-level models estimate the likelihood of a student making a level jump based on their performance across various competencies and past levels in different subjects. The probability of a level jump is influenced by both their overall past performance and their scores across key competencies, offering a nuanced prediction of their academic progression.</p>
<p><em>Baseline level</em> stands for the previous learning level of the student, which varies from 1 (Inception) to 5 (Class 9).</p>

<h1 style="color: #a35edb;">School Improvement Model Overview</h1>
<h3 style="color: #64e3b2;">Outcome Variable: School Improvement</h3>
<p>Schools are categorized into four groups based on student performance improvement from baseline to endline assessments:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>No Improvement:</strong> Student percentages in inception, class 3, and class 5 increase.</li>
    <li><strong>Little Improvement:</strong> Improvement is better than at most 50% of schools.</li>
    <li><strong>Considerable Improvement:</strong> Improvement is better than 50-75% of schools.</li>
    <li><strong>High Improvement:</strong> Improvement is better than at least 75% of schools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Improvement is defined as a decrease in student percentages in the specified classes from baseline to endline, with schools further categorized based on comparative performance.</p>
<h3 style="color: #64e3b2;">Independent Variables</h3>
<p>The model analyzes factors influencing school improvement, including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Sanitation Index:</strong> Quality and availability of sanitation facilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Teacher Quality Index:</strong> Teacher qualifications and numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>Infrastructure Index:</strong> Physical resources and infrastructure.</li>
    <li><strong>Caste Diversity:</strong> Student diversity based on caste.</li>
    <li><strong>Digital Index:</strong> Integration and digital infrastructure.</li>
    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Rural or urban setting.</li>
    <li><strong>Vigilance:</strong> Level of oversight and monitoring.</li>
</ul>

<h4 style="color: #a35edb;">Discretion Notice</h4>
<p>The models in this Streamlit application are based on offline data from Karnataka for Class-9 students and are reflective of the specific dataset they were trained on. While these models offer valuable insights, their predictive power is limited. As such, the results should be interpreted with care and discretion.</p>
